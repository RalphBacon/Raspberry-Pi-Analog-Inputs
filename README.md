The Raspberry Pi (I'm using a Model 3B+) has no analog input pins at all. So how do you measure analog voltages then? Connect a Microchip Analog-toDigital-Converter (ADC) chip that uses SPI and you're in business. Just to make it _really_ easy we can use a kit of parts from RasPiO, a UK-based company (I have no connection with this company at all, and I didn't get the product for free or at a reduced rate).

I noticed whilst editing this video that the audio could vary as I turned from desk to soldering station; I'm already thinking of what I can do to improve this (without buying another expensive microphone). I might be able to use the built-in microphone from my video camera to augment the audio. We shall see how it works in future videos!

The sketch (OK, Python program) can be found here in my Github
